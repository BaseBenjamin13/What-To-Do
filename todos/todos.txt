✅ make input component.

✅ inside form, map through inputs

BUG: if user adds input, clicks submit and then removes input, 
    it will still be in the couldDos array. 
    meaning theres still a chance for the doThis value to ba a removed value.
    COULD FIX: when user removes input, that input value should also be removed from couldDos.
